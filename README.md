# Pedro Muñoz

I design Artificial Intelligence systems for companies, it's both my passion and my profession. Over the years, I've built one of Spain's most specialized AI firms, with a focus on technical excellence and delivering practical, impactful solutions. I’m proud that our reputation is built on real results and client reviews rather than sales presentations.

Beyond my work at WhiteBox, I launched one of Spain’s first DaaS platforms, DataMarket, and was honored to represent Spain at the AWS DeepRacer World League in Las Vegas after winning the national league in 2019. I also hold honors degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mathematics from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.
