# Pedro Muñoz

✅ I help companies and organizations to solve their problems through data analysis. I like to do a careful and very organized work so that my solutions stand out.

✅ I have a broad experience in the Big Data ecosystem (Spark, Impala, Flume...) and in the Machine Learning one (Tensorflow, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn...).

✅ I am the AWS DeepRacer Spanish League winner, where I developed an autonomous driven car model using Reinforcement Learning.

✅ I am the creator of an open source project [datatau](https://datatau.net), which is a Data Science newsboard based on Hacker News, [datamarket](https://datamarket.es), one of the first DaaS (Data as a Service) platforms in Spain, and [elminutador](https://elminutador.es) a real time speech to text tool fine-tuned for Spain TV and media.

✅ You can get a detailed CV at [pedro-munoz.tech](https://pedro-munoz.tech). I'm currently doing AI consultancy at my own company [WhiteBoxᴹᴸ](https://whiteboxml.com), which I founded in 2019.
